## Introduction

- Continuing with the last project theme, I will do a quick analysis of my climbing stats
- I will look at the distribution of 2 variables: elevation (how tall a peak is) and prominence (height of a peak relative to its surroundings) using a histogram
- Both histograms shown in this project were made using Plotly (code is included on the slides) and can be found on slides 7 and 8

## Climbing is fun!

## Data summary

```{r data, echo=FALSE}
mydata <- read.csv('honorio_peak_data.csv')
summary(mydata)
el <- mydata[,'elevation']
pr <- mydata[,'prominence']
```

## Where have I attained summits 

- The map in the following slide was made using the code from the previous assignment
- Code available in https://github.com/honvales/DataProductsProject2

## Summit map

```{r map, message=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
library(leaflet.providers)
df <- data.frame(latitude=mydata[,1], longitude=mydata[,2])

mydata %>% 
  leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addProviderTiles(providers$OpenTopoMap, group='Topo') %>%
  addMarkers(popup=mydata[,3],clusterOptions=markerClusterOptions())

```

## Elevation histogram (in ft)

```{r elevation, echo=TRUE, message=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
plot_ly(x = el, type='histogram')
```

## Prominence histogram (in ft)

```{r prominence, echo=TRUE}
plot_ly(x = pr, type='histogram')
```

## Conclusions

- Most of the peaks that I have climbed have elevations above 8000 ft or below 1000 ft (thanks COVID)
- Most of the peaks that I climb have a prominence below 1000 ft
